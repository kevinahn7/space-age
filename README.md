#### By Kevin Ahn

## Description

To build a calculator to determine your age on different planets

## Specs


* Take two dates and determine the difference, in seconds, between the two. (This way a user can enter a birthdate and the application can compare the birthdate against the current time to come up with an accurate age.)

* Determine how many years a user has left to live on each planet.
* If a user has already surpassed the average life expectancy, return the number of years they have lived past the life expectancy.

| Spec | Input | Output |
| :-------------     | :------------- | :------------- |
| **Take a person’s age in years and convert it into seconds**| Enter: 10 | Output: 315569000 |
| **Return the age of a human in Mercury years** | Enter: 10 | Output: 41 |
| **Return the age of a human in Venus years** | Enter: 10 | Output: 16 |
| **Return the age of a human in Mars years** | Enter: 10 | Output: 5 |
| **Return the age of a human in Jupiter years** | Enter: 10 | Output: 0 |
